* [***News***] Now, the training and testing code of a stronger version CPMNet & SCPMNet can be found [CPMNetV2](https://github.com/zunzhumu/CPMNetv2).
* Code for the early accepted MICCAI2020 paper "CPM-Net: A 3D Center-Points Matching Network for Pulmonary Nodule Detection in CT Scans" ([MICCAI2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59725-2_53)) and its journal extension pubished on **Medical Image Analysis** "SCPM-Net: An Anchor-free 3D Lung Nodule Detection Network using Sphere Representation and Center Points Matching" ([MedIA2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841521003327)).
